Welcome to Life World: (version 1.0 currently incomplete)

Similar to but not same with popular programming game - life game, life world is a self-evolved world to let the creatures inside to compete with each other (limit source), evolve depends on environment (limit number of creatures) and survive by strategy (may add some machine learning methods in later version, currently not support).
